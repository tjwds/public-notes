# "gaming" pc

Instead of buying a next-gen console I'd basically never play, I want to put together a gaming PC setup that… I'll basically never use.  These are very rough-hewn notes that I'm just using to organize my thoughts.

## shared use

I want M to be able to use the machine as well, and I'd like to be able to configure the input sources.  So, essentially, what I'd like to do is have two switches:

```
• M's display         ---┐ ┌---  • my displays
• M's input sources¹  ---┤ ├---  • my input sources
                       switch
                           └---  PC
```

¹ TODO potential problem:  M uses bluetooth input devices.

Bluetooth makes this much, much more complicated.  We both use bluetooth audio sources, and M uses bluetooth input.  Maybe there's a way to have one bluetooth "mount" point, which can be toggled between two machines?  But both of us use macbook pros, which would mean that we wouldn't be able to just undock and continue to use our headphones because of the connection model on our preferred headphones (Bose QuietComfort 35 II).

I'd also want to have my input sources be switchable, so I could CHA-CHUNK two hardware buttons to flip the display and keyboard over.

We'd have to route some cables pretty far, but I think that'd be pretty cool looking, if we did it right.
