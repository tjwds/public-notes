# What even is this?

This is the simplest static site generator I could think to build.  It walks a tree of markdown files, sticks them in an _extremely_ simple template, and uses Apache's built-in fancy indexer to build the index of those files.  That's it!

The code for this currently lives in two places:  [the repository for the static site generation part](https://github.com/tjwds/static-wrapper), and the [repository for the notes themselves](https://github.com/tjwds/public-notes).
