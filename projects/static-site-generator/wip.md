# static site generator progress

done:

* create the html from markdown files
* stick markdown files in the template
* a better theme (done for now, I suppose)
* some semblance of navigation / metadata because of Apache

todo:

* RSS?  Does RSS even make sense if this is more wiki like?  Probably not.
* Very tiny tweaks to make it look correct on mobile too — padding, mostly
