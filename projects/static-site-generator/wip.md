# static site generator progress

done:

* create the html from markdown files
* stick markdown files in the template
* a better theme (done for now, I suppose)
* some semblance of navigation / metadata because of Apache
* lookin' alright on mobile, too

todo:

* RSS?  Does RSS even make sense if this is more wiki like?  Probably not.
