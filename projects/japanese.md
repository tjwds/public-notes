# japanese

My current, in-progress Japanese plan (as of November 15th, 2020):

* Learning Kanji with [the KanjiDamage Anki deck](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/748570187).
	* I'm adding two new cards a day, which means I'll finish the deck on March 24th, 2025.
* Doing roughly 50 XP of Duolingo a day.
	* I _think_ I do roughly two full lessons every three days. I completely finish each lesson, completing it five times, relatively close to having started it, only working on two or three lessons at a time.  At this rate, I'll finish Duolingo sometime around September 25th, 2022.
